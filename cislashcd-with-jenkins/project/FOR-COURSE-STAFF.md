This project needs a bit of understanding about Kubernetes, even if we haven't learned it yet. Students should know how to:

- Make simple Deployments and Services
- Use NodePort services
- Access services using port-forwarding.

Start this project after finishing the "core objects" tutorial in the Orchestration module.
