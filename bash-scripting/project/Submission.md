After clicking on the commit button, write some info message regarding your commit in the **Commit Message** and click the **Commit** button. Commit messages are usually free text written by the developer, providing some information regarding the changes you are committing. Examples could be something like "initial solution" or "bash project solution - work in progress" or "bash project - final solution!". Feel free to fix your code and commit the changes again and again. You can commit as much as you want.

Then push your solution to GitHub using the button pictured below. Bravo! You've submitted your solution!

Your solution has to pass automated tests. Go to **GitHub actions** and make sure your solution has passed the tests. You must see the following message:
```bash
Well Done! you've passed all tests
```
Otherwise, your solution has to be fixed. Do your changes, commit and push again.

Good Luck!
