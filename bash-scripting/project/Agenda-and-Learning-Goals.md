# This project will cover:
- Most of the discussed main topics in both Linux and Bash courses.  
- Working with files and permissions, config bash environment, variables, if statements, user management, working with processes, etcâ€¦
- You will be required to handle some material that has not been covered or taught before, like aliases, processes and ports, and working with Git. 

# Learning outcomes:
- Writing bash scripts that are integrated into a larger system, rather than standalone scripts.
- Deepening Linux and Bash skills 
- Developing programming skills of precise code writing by enforcing the student to pass automated tests.
