Having written a bash script, you can invoke it in two ways:
- `./myscript.sh` - This is the method weâ€™ve seen so far. It runs the script as an executable file, using the interpreter specified in the shebang line. If the script is not marked as executable, you will get a "Permission denied" error.
- `bash myscript.sh` - This explicitly runs the script using the bash shell, regardless of the shebang line (`#!/bin/bash`) at the beginning of the script. This means that even if the script is not marked as executable (`chmod +x myscript.sh`), you can still run it.
