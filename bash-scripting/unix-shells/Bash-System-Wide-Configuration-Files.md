Before we begin, it is important to distinguish between subtly different types of shells: login and non-login shells, and interactive and non-interactive shells.

- A **login shell** is executed only after a user logs into the system.
- A **non-login shell** is started within a user's current session (shells that are spawned from within an existing shell session).
- An **interactive shell** allows the user to interact with the system through a command-line interface.
- A **non-interactive shell** is not designed for user interaction and is typically used for running scripts or commands in the background.
