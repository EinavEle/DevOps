Let's calculate the atomic energy of a 1 nanogram mass object.

We all know Albert Einstein's famous formula: `E = mc^2`



Let's use it to calculate the relevant mass.

Define **variables** with full names to represent the relevant components of the formula.

Some important information:

- The mass in the formula is of kilograms
- In order to calculate what is nano gram in kilograms, you need to divide it by 1000
- The energy is in joule units
- You can use the proximity for the `c` component (calculated my meters)


Finally, print the received energy with a nice message:

the energy is: \<x joules>





The final print of the energy should be:
```
The energy is: 90000.0 joules 
```
