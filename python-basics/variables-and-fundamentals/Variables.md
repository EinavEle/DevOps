A variable is the simplest way for the computer to "remember" some information.

We want the computer to remember certain values so that we can use them throughout our program.



For example, if we have a shopping app that manages many users and we want to:



- Greet our user when they log in
- Recommend an item to them personally
- Thank them when they make a purchase


We would want the app to remember that the current user's name is "Serena", rather than writing out her name each time.
