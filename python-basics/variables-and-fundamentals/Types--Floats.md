As in the real world, we often deal with numbers that aren't whole (i.e. integers).



In Python, a fraction, or decimal number is called a `float`, and we define it like this:


```
price_of_butter = 1.26 
```

The `price_of_butter` falls under the category of a **Number**, so we will be able to do mathematical operations with it, but Python will "remember" this slightly differently than plain integers - we don't really need to worry about what's going on behind the scene, just that we have these two different types: **ints** and **floats**.
