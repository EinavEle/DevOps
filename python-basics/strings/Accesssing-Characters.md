We can access the characters of a string using an index.



**Note**: we start counting from `0`



The first letter is located in index `0`

The second letter is located in index `1`

and so on...
```
index:   0 1 2 3 4
string: "H e l l o"
```
to print the first letter we will do:
```
word = "Liliput"
print(word[0])
```

to print the third character we will do:
```
print(word[2])
```
