In this lesson we're going to learn an extremely powerful tool: loops.



Loops allow us to perform an operation multiple times where each **iteration** does something slightly different.

We can use loops to execute repetitive tasks, or to solve problems.



By the end of this lesson you will:
- Be able to write loops in Python
- Understand the concept of **iteration**
- Be able to write simple algorithms using loops
