In this lesson we're going to talk about basic control flow in Python.

In particular, we're going to discuss the following **conditional statements**:



- if
- elif
- else


Generally we use these statements to execute operations based on certain conditions. A classic example might be trying to make an online transfer from your bank. You can only execute this operation **if** you have enough money in the bank for the transfer.



By the end of this lesson you should understand how to translate this kind of business logic into Python code.
