Of course, a function can receive more than just one parameter:


```
def introduce(name, country):
	print(name + " " + " is from " + country)

introduce("Sam", "USA") # outputs: Sam is from USA
introduce("Nunzia", "Italy") # outputs: Nunzia is from Italy
```

Notice that the only difference is that we separate our parameters and our arguments with a comma.
