An Amazon Machine Image (**AMI**) is a pre-configured virtual machine image used to create EC2 instances.
AMIs contain all the information needed to launch a new instance, including the operating system, application server, and any additional software.
AMIs provide a fast and reliable way to launch instances with specific configurations, making it easy to replicate complex environments or deploy new instances with consistent configurations.
