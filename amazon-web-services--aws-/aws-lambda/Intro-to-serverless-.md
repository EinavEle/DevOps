Serverless architectures are a cloud computing paradigm that allows developers to build and deploy applications without the need to manage servers directly (PaaS).
In this model, the cloud provider takes care of server provisioning, scaling, and maintenance, enabling developers to focus solely on writing code and paying only for the actual resources consumed during execution. 

This approach offers reduced operational overhead, improved cost efficiency, and faster time-to-market for various types of applications and services.
