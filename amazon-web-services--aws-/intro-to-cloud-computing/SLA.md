AWS Service Level Agreements (**SLA**) are commitments made by AWS to its customers regarding the availability and performance of its cloud services.
SLAs specify the percentage of uptime that customers can expect from AWS services and the compensation they can receive if AWS fails to meet these commitments. 
AWS offers different SLAs for different services, and the SLAs can vary based on the region and the type of service used. AWS SLAs provide customers with a level of assurance and confidence in the reliability and availability of the cloud services they use.
