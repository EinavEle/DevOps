Cloud computing is a technology that allows businesses and individuals to access and use computing resources over the internet, without the need for owning or maintaining physical hardware. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leading provider of cloud computing services, offering a wide range of tools and platforms that enable businesses to deploy, scale, and manage their applications and data in the cloud. With AWS, organizations can benefit from the flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of cloud computing, while focusing on their core business objectives.
