1. Create a dedicated GitHub repo for the project.
2. Pull our shared repository to get an up-to-date version. All project files are located under `docker_project/`.
3. Create a Telegram Bot:
    - <a href="https://desktop.telegram.org/" target="_blank">Download</a> and install telegram desktop (you can   use your phone app as well).
    - Once installed, create your own Telegram Bot by following <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#botfather">this section</a> to create a bot. Once you have your telegram token you can move to the next step.

**Never** commit your telegram token in Git repo, even if the repo is private.
For now, we will provide the token as an environment variable to your chat app. 
Later on in the course we will learn better approaches to store sensitive data.
