Run the `nginx` container by:
```bash
docker pull nginx
docker run nginx
```
When you run this command, the following happens (assuming you are using the default DockerHub registry configuration):
1. Docker pulls the `nginx` image from DockerHub.
1. Docker creates a new container from the `nginx` image. The `nginx` image is a ready-to-run container image that encapsulates the [NGINX web server](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/nginx/) software, along with its dependencies and configuration. When the image is used to create a container, it provides a fully functional NGINX server environment, without the need to install and configure nginx on your machine.
1. Docker allocates a dedicated read-write filesystem to the container (which is completely different and isolated from the host machine fs). This allows a running container to create or modify files and directories in its local filesystem.
1. Docker creates a **virtual network interface** to connect the container to the network. This includes assigning an IP address to the container. By default, containers can connect to external networks using the host machineâ€™s network connection.
1. Docker starts the container.
1. When you type `CTRL+c` the container stops but is not removed. You can start it again or remove it. When a container is removed, its file system is deleted.
