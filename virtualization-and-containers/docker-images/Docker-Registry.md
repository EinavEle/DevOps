Where do the images we ran in the previous module come from?

The images used in Docker, including the ones you've run in the previous module, typically come from **Docker registries**. A Docker registry is a centralized repository for storing and distributing container images. It serves as a hub where you can find pre-built container images created by others or upload and share your own images.

By default, Docker pulls images from the [DockerHub registry](https://hub.docker.com/), which is a public registry provided by Docker. Docker Hub hosts a vast collection of official and community-contributed images for a wide range of applications and operating systems. It is a popular source for finding and sharing container images.

However, Docker also allows you to work with **private registries**. Organizations often set up private registries to store proprietary or sensitive container images. Private registries offer control over image distribution, access control, and integration with other deployment pipelines or processes.
