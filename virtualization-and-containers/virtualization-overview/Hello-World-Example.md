The Docker "Hello World" container is a simple and lightweight container that is often used to verify if Docker is properly installed and functioning on a system. It is based on the official Docker image called [hello-world](https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world).
```bash
docker run hello-world
```
The hello-world image is an example of minimal containerization with Docker. It has a single `hello.c` file responsible for printing out the message you're seeing on your terminal.
