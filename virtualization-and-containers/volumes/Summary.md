No matter which type of mount you choose to use, the data looks the same **from within the container**. It is exposed as either a directory or an individual file in the containerâ€™s filesystem.

An easy way to visualize the difference among volumes, bind mounts, and tmpfs mounts is to think about where the data lives on the host machine.

- **Volumes** are stored in a part of the host filesystem which is **managed by Docker** (`/var/lib/docker/volumes/` on Linux). Non-Docker processes should not modify this part of the filesystem.
- **Bind mounts** may be stored *anywhere* on the host system. They may even be important system files or directories. Non-Docker processes on the host machine or a Docker container can modify them at any time.
- `tmpfs` **mounts** are stored in the host system's memory only, and are never written to the host system's filesystem.
