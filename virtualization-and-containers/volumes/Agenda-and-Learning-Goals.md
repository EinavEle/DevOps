# This unit will cover:
- Understanding why containers are essentially not persistent.
- Docker volume mounting: bind-mounts, volumes, tmpfs.
- Security implications when mounting volumes.

# At the end of this unit youâ€™ll be able to:
- Persist data of stateful containers, such as databases.
- Use different mapping techniques using the `-v` flag in the `docker run` command.
- Use different types of volumes, depending on the use case.
