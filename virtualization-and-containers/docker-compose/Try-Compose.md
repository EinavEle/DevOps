In this course we will briefly introduce Docker Compose only as a stepping stone towards learning Kubernetes. Docker Compose is a nice tool to get yourself familiar with the concept of container orchestration and deployment. However, Kubernetes (k8s) is a way more powerful orchestration platform, which will be learnt later on in the course.
The official Docker Compose website provides a good getting started tutorial with Docker Compose, explaining key concepts and demonstrating how to write a Compose file. Complete the tutorial: https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/
