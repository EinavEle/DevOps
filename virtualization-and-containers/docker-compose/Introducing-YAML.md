YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data format commonly used for configuration files and data exchange between systems. YAML is the cousin of JSON, in that it uses indentation and key-value pairs to represent structured data, but in a more clean syntax.

To prepare for working with Docker Compose, and later with Kubernetes, it is important to familiarize yourself with YAML syntax, which is the preferred syntax for writing Docker Compose files.
