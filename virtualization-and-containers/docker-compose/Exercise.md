# Exercise - Flask, Nginx, MongoDB
Create `docker-compose.yaml` file for the following containers architecture:
![.guides/img/image3](./image3.png)
- The Dockerfiles of the nginx and the flask services can be found in our shared repo under `nginx_flask_mongodb`.
- The mongo service should be run using the pre-built [official Mongo image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo). **The database data should be persistent**.
- The nginx and flask services should be connected to a custom bridge network called `public-net-1` network.
- In addition, the flask service and mongo should be connected to a custom bridge network called `private-net-1` network.
- The nginx should talk with flask using the `flask-app` hostname.
- The flask service should talk to the `mongo` using the mongo hostname.
