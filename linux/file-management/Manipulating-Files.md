Let's review some basic commands that you can use to navigate and control the file system:
- `cd` - change directory.
- `mkdir [options] <Directory>` - create directory.
- `rmdir [options] <Directory>` - remove directory.
- `touch [options] <filename>` - create a file.
- `cp [options] <source> <destination>` - copy file to another location.
- `mv [options] <source> <destination>` - move file to another location.
- `rm [options] <file>` - remove file from the fs.
- `cat <filename>` - print the content of a given file.

Note: there is no undo! The Linux cli does not have an undo feature. Perform destructive actions carefully.
