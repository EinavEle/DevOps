In Linux, each user has a HOME directory which serves as their default working directory when they log in. This directory contains the user's personal files and settings, and is typically located at `/home/<username>`,  while `<username>` is the username. The HOME directory is protected by file permissions to ensure that only the user and authorized system administrators can access it.

Here are a few ways to access to a user's home directory in Linux:
1. Using the tilde (`~`) character. Simply use the command `cd ~` or `cd` to change to your own home directory.
1. Using the absolute path, typically `/home/username`. 
1. Using the `$HOME` variable: Linux also has a built-in **environment variable** called `$HOME`, which contains the path to the current user's home directory. You can use the command `cd $HOME` to change to your own home directory (Variables will be discussed later on).
