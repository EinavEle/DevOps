The `export` command is used to set environment variables in the current shell session or to export variables to **child processes**.

When a variable is exported using the `export` command, it becomes available to any child process that is spawned by the current shell. This is useful when you need to pass environment variables to programs or scripts that you run.

For example, let's say you want to add a directory called `mytools` to your `PATH` environment variable so that you can run executables stored in that directory. You can do this by running the following command:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/home/myuser/mytools
```
This command adds the directory `/home/myuser/mytools` to the existing PATH environment variable, which is a colon-separated list of directories that the shell searches for executable files within.

If you only set the `PATH` variable without exporting it, it will only be available in the current shell session and will not be inherited by child processes.
```bash
PATH=$PATH:/home/myuser/mytools
```
