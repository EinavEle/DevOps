A process is a currently executing program (or command). A program is a series of instructions that tell the computer what to do. When we run a program, those instructions are copied into memory and space is allocated for variables and other stuff required to manage its execution. This running instance of a program is called a **process**.

The `top` command can show running processes in the terminal in real-time.
```bash
myuser@hostname:~$ top
...
```
