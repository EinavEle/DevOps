# Create group shared GitHub repo

1. Create a GitHub repo for your group (create it under your own account, it'll be much more convenient). 

2. The repo content should be based on (ask Elevation for permissions if needed):

https://github.com/Elevationacademy/devops-bootcamp.git

You can simple clone this repo and copy-paste the content, or (better) to add your group repo as a remote and push it there. 

3. Collect a GitHub users list of your group and add them as a collaborators to the shared repo. They will push some code there in future projects. 


# Create AWS users

At some point in the course, your students would have to access a shared AWS account. Ask Elevation team an access to the AWS account and create IAM users for each student. To protect the account, the created IAM users must belong to the `students` group, which has limited permissions on the account.
