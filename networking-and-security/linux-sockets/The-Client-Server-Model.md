Most networking applications today are designed around a client-server relationship. The **client** is usually an application acting on behalf of a person, such as a web browser accessing google.com. The **server** is generally an application that is providing some service, such as supplying the content of the web page of google.com.

Servers are **Highly Available (HA)**. Usually, processes implementing the server are running as [linux services](https://github.com/alonitac/DevOpsFeb23/blob/main/tutorials/06_linux_processes.md#services), started at boot time, and continue to run until the machine is shutdown. Usually, clients can use the server's **hostname** (e.g. google.com, console.aws.com...), which is a friendly name that can be converted into the IP Address of the server using the **Domain Name Service (DNS)** system.
