**Cryptography** is the science of using mathematics to encrypt and decrypt data.

A cryptographic algorithm, or **cipher**, is a mathematical function used in the encryption and decryption process. A cryptographic algorithm works in combination with a key —a word, number, or phrase— to encrypt the plaintext. The same plaintext encrypts to different ciphertext with different keys.
