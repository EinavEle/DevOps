There are three ranges of private IP addresses defined in [RFC 1918](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1918):
- 10.0.0.0/8
- 172.16.0.0/12
- 192.168.0.0/16

These addresses can be used for internal networks within an organization, but they are not routable on the public Internet.

Public IP addresses, on the other hand, are assigned by Internet authorities and are used to identify devices that are directly accessible from the Internet.
