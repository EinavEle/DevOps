An API (Application Programming Interface) can be thought of as a collection of all server endpoints that together define the functionality that is exposed to the client. Each endpoint typically accepts input parameters in a specific format and returns output data in a standard format such as JSON or XML.

For example, a web API for a social media platform might include endpoints for retrieving a user's profile information, posting a new status update, or searching for other users. Each endpoint would have a unique URL and a specific set of input parameters and output data.

Many platforms that we will be learning about during the course expose a rich API, as well as GUI.
