		"instructions": "A **load balancer** is a piece of software that efficiently distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers.\n\nBy default, a load balancer redirects an incoming requests to a random server:\n![alt text](.guides/img/compcheckpic.png)\nSometimes, it is useful to redirect incoming requests to the same server with which a given user was originally redirected to. For example, if a given user was redirected to server B when initially accessed the website, from now on, the load balancer will redirect every request of this user to server B/\n\nThis process is called a **Sticky Session**. The load balancer creates an affinity between a client and a specific server for the duration of a session.\n\nHow could that be achieved using cookies?",
