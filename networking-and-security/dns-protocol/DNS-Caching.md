**Caching** is a mechanism used to store frequently accessed data in a local storage (cache) to reduce the time and resources required to retrieve the data from the original source. When data is requested, it is first checked in the cache, and if it is found there, it is returned quickly without accessing the original source. If the data is not in the cache, it is retrieved from the original source, stored in the cache, and returned to the requester. This process can help to improve the performance and scalability of applications by reducing the load on the original data source and minimizing network latency.

When a DNS server receives a DNS record, it can cache the record in its local memory. Thus, the DNS server can provide the desired IP address, even if it is not authoritative for the hostname. A local DNS server can also cache the IP addresses of TLD servers, thereby allowing the local DNS server to bypass the root DNS servers in a query chain (this often happens). Because hosts and mappings between hostnames and IP addresses are by no means permanent, DNS servers discard cached information after a period of time, known as **Time to Live (TTL)**.
