# This unit will cover:
- Symmetric key encryption.
- Asymmetric key encryption: public key encryption and digital signature.
- Certificates.
- The TLS handshake process.

# At the end of this unit youâ€™ll be able to:
- Encrypt and decrypt data using symmetric methods.
- Generate key-pair and use it in both encryption and digital signature.
- Understand the potential risks in insecure communication.
- Understand certificates and CAs.
- Understand the TLS handshake process.
