The SSH protocol (Secure Shell) is a widely used protocol for secure remote access to systems and devices. It provides strong encryption and authentication mechanisms, allowing users to securely log in to remote machines and execute commands or transfer files.

In addition to traditional password authentication, the Secure Shell application can use public key cryptography to authenticate users.
