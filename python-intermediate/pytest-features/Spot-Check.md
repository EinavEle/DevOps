## Mark Spot Check
### Instructions :

1. Create a new mark named `low3`, that will run the tests where the result of calling sum is **lower than 3**.
2. Add the new mark to the relevant tests.
3. Finally run the low3 group of tests.


Make sure only the relevant tests were running *(remember how to see which tests ran?)*
