Sometimes we need the computer to remember information that is more complex than a single value, and we want it to stay associated.



For example, a user might have the following properties:

- name
- username
- age
- whether the user has purchased something before
- etc..


We certainly don't want to create a separate variable for each of this, for each of the users on our app - so instead we will create what is known as a `dict` in Python; short for **dictionary**.



By the end of this lesson you will:

- Understand what a dict is
- Know how to create a dict
- Know how to work with key-value pairs
- Understand how to work with complex data
