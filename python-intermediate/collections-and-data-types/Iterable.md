Another important distinguish is if a certain type is iterable.


The iterable types are:

- all sequences:
  - list
  - string
  - tuple
- dictionary
- set
- file object


There are many operations that are relevant to all the iterables:

- min / max
- zip
- sum
- sorted
- map
- enumerate
- filter
- any / all
- and more...


So this is something that is good to remember.

That is all.
No exercises for this chapter, just remember what we've talked about.
