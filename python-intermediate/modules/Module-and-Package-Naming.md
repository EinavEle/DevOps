**Make sure to name your modules properly.**

- Module names should be *all* **lower case**.
- **Underscores** are *allowed* to improve readability.
```
products.py
math_utils.py 
```
- You are *not allowed* to use:
  - dot
  - dash
  - Capital letters
- A module name *cannot* start with a **number**


### Not allowed:
```import
math.utils.py # dot
math-utils.py # dash
Users.py # capital letter
2users.py # start with a digit 
```
Packages should also have short, all-lowercase names, although **the use of underscores is discouraged**.
