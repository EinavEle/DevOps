Import module math, and use its functions to write the following:

- An expression that calculates the floor of -5.3
- An expression that calculates the ceiling of tangent of 16.8.
- A function that calculate the area of a regular polygon with n sides and length of each side is l. 
    The formula to find the area of a regular polygon is:
```
(n * (l)^2)/(4 * tan(Ï€/n))
```
