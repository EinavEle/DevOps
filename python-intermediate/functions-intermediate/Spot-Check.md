Write a function `get_power_of` that generates a function that calculates exponents.

When passing the function `get_power_of` the number 3 it should return a function that calculates the power of 3.


Here is a small check to make sure you understand how this should go:
```python
def get_power_of():
  # write your code here


calc_power_of_2 = get_power_of(2)
calc_power_of_4 = get_power_of(4)
print(calc_power_of_2(5))    # 5^2 = 25
print(calc_power_of_2(7))    # 7^2 = 49
print(calc_power_of_4(2))    # 2^4 = 16
print(calc_power_of_4(3))    # 3^4 = 81 
```
