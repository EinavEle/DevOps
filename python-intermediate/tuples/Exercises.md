## Exercise 1

Create a tuple named `my_tuple` and fill it with 8 elements form different types.





## Exercise 2

Given the tuple `my_tuple` from Exercise 1:

Write code that print the 4th element and 4th element from last of that tuple.






## Exercise 3

Given the following tuple:
```
days = ("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday")
```
Write code that remove `Tuesday` from days tuple and print it.





## Exercise 4

Given the following tuple:
```python
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
```
Write code that reverse this tuple and print it.






## Exercise 5



1. Using slice only, write a function that will return a reversed tuple minus the first element.



Example:
```
(1,2,3) => (3,2)
(2,4,6,8,10,12) => (12,10,8,6,4)
```





2. Write a function that will return a reversed tuple minus the last element.



Example:
```
(1,2,3) => (2, 1)
(2,4,6,8,10,12) => (10, 8, 6, 4, 2)
```
