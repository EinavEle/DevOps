Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is an important **programming paradigm** popular in the programming world.

OOP is popular because a lot of the code we write involves manipulating objects, so we want that to be our focus.

In the past (and some still do today) developers wrote in a style known as [procedural programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming) which was more focused on logic than data. In OOP we put data before logic.

By the end of this lesson we will learn the basics of OOP, and specifically how to work with:

- Classes
- Attributes, Constructor, & Instantiation
- Methods
