In this lesson, we will talk about **warning and exceptions in Python**.


There are times when we want to alert the user about a situation in our code without terminating the program - in that case adding **warning** to our code can be very useful.

There are times when we want to forces our program to output an error when something in it goes wrong - in that case using **exceptions** handling can be very helpful.

These two methodologies will motivate us to write clean, readable and efficient code in Python.


By the end of this lesson you will know when to use and how to handle warning and exceptions in your Python program.
