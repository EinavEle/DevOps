Read the `turtles.json` file, loop over it, and then create a JSON file called `turtles_summary.json` file (with code).

Ultimately, your JSON will look like this:

```python
{
  "male": {
    "total": 24,
    "alive": 16
  },
    "female": {
    "total": 26,
    "alive": 14
  }
} 
```

To do this, you can complete the following steps:

- Read the file
- Create a summary variable: an empty "template" dict with the keys you need
- Loop through the data
- Update the summary dict accordingly per turtle
- Use the gender and status keys to count the data you need
