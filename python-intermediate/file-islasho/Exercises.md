Reading from and writing to files is a straightforward, but powerful ability. It helps us automate tasks, generate reports, and run analyses on existing data. Let's practice:



## Exercise #1

Using this list:

```python
quizzes = [
  {"name": "Guillermo", "quiz1": 80, "quiz2": 85, "quiz3": 82},
  {"name": "Jamie", "quiz1": 78, "quiz2": 72, "quiz3": 80},
  {"name": "Otto", "quiz1": 92, "quiz2": 89, "quiz3": 96},
  {"name": "Christina", "quiz1": 91, "quiz2": 85, "quiz3": 94},
  {"name": "Ceasar", "quiz1": 62, "quiz2": 65, "quiz3": 73},
  {"name": "Barbara", "quiz1": 78, "quiz2": 68, "quiz3": 78},
  {"name": "Rosan", "quiz1": 84, "quiz2": 85, "quiz3": 81},
  {"name": "Marco", "quiz1": 79, "quiz2": 72, "quiz3": 87},
] 
```

Create a new `.txt` file for each student. The name of the file should be in the format <name>`_final_report.txt`, and should look like this:

```console
Quiz 1: <score>
Quiz 2: <score>
Quiz 3: <score>
----
Average: <calculate-average> 
```


## Exercise #2

Convert this dict into a `JSON` file: **Do not** modify the original dict.

```json
[
  {"name": "Afghanistan", "code": "AF"},
  {"name": "Ã…land Islands", "code": "AX"},
  {"name": "Albania", "code": "AL"},
  {"name": "Algeria", "code": "DZ"},
  {"name": "American Samoa", "code": "AS"},
  {"name": "Western Sahara", "code": "EH"},
  {"name": "Yemen", "code": "YE"},
  {"name": "Zambia", "code": "ZM"},
  {"name": "Zimbabwe", "code": "ZW"}
] 
```


## Exercise #3

Read [this .txt file](https://github.com/Elevationacademy/python-spotcheck-solutions/blob/master/File-IO/ikea.txt), and save its data into both a `JSON` and a `CSV` file.


The CSV should look like this:
```console
item, price
closet, 500
hammer, 18
bed, 300
fridge, 800
... 
```

And the JSON should look like this:
```json
[
  {"closet": 500},
  {"hammer": 18},
  {"bed": 300},
  {"fridge": 800},
  ...
] 
```

**Hint:** You might want to use the [split command](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_split.asp) to `split` the text into two parts: the `name` and the `price`. Because all the rows in the .txt file have a - in between the name and price, you can use that as your indicator for where to split.



## Exercise #4

Use [this CSV](https://github.com/Elevationacademy/python-spotcheck-solutions/blob/master/File-IO/test_reports.csv) and [this JSON](https://github.com/Elevationacademy/python-spotcheck-solutions/blob/master/File-IO/test_reports.json), and combine them into one .txt file with the following format:

```console
Report: <report_name>
Number: <report-count>
-----
Time: <time>
Owner: <owner>
Category: <category> - <sub-category>
FAIL/PASS
<status-dependant>
======================================
Report: <report_name>
etc... 
```

Notes:

- You'll have to save the CSV and JSON data into your own files.
- Do not modify either the CSV or the JSON files.
- There is no report - count data in the CSV/JSON - you have to generate the count as you go.
- You should display either `FAIL` or `PASS` as the last field; depending on the value of status.
- For any empty values, display a `***`



## Extension

Write a program that will generate csv files with nutrition values according to specific diets.
The grogram will get the data from a json file.


Here is an example json file: [JSON](https://github.com/noizwaves/nutrition/blob/master/data/food.json). **Do not** modify the JSON file.


The program should know how to analyse the data in the JSON file, and save it into a CSV file, saving only the relevant nutrition data.


For example, maybe for a sports diet we would like to focus on protein, and carbohydrate,

So our CSV would look like this:
```csv
name, protein, carbohydrate
Muesli (Almond), 12.3, 51.7
Wholegrain Rolled Oats, 13.3, 60.3
Almond Milk, 0.5, 4.6
      ...  
```

For weight loss we might want to focus on fat and sugars,

so our csv would look like this:
```csv
name, fat, sugars
Muesli (Almond), 9.9,19.7
Wholegrain Rolled Oats, 9.8, 1.2
Almond Milk,1.2, 4.4
... 
```

Try to write generic code, that will allow easy and safe changes when needed.


**Note:** There is more data in the `JSON` than you need to save in the `CSV`, **but** not all of the fields exist for all the data - so make sure you're validating accordingly.
