Continuing with the `example.txt` file, add all of the following items to the file, line by line, *only if* their first letter is "C":

```python
goodies = ["Barnacle", "Circus", "Rake", "Cherry", "Steam", "Toothpaste", "Knee", "Coat"] 
```

**Hint:** you can check a string's first letter using the same syntax you use for checking a list's first item.


Give this a good while before verifying your [solution here](https://github.com/Elevationacademy/python-spotcheck-solutions/blob/master/File-IO/sc2.py).
