A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character

```
good = True
_var = "hello" 
```

A variable name cannot start with a number

```
# Error
3boxes = 7 
```

A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )

```
my_var2 = 7 
```

separate words using underscore _:

```
user_name = "momo" 
```

Variable names are **case-sensitive**.

These are three different variables:

```
AGE = 20
age = 23
Age = 21 
```

**Constants** are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words:

```
STEP_LIMIT = 8
```
